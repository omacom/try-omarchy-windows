# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added CI for launcher builds, release-pin validation, and guest patch contracts.
- Added a two-phase release workflow that rebuilds and smoke-tests the guest, signs the optimized launcher through Azure OIDC, and verifies public downloads before marking a release Latest.
- Added authenticated automatic updates for the launcher, bundled runtime, and factory guest image, with staged installs and automatic rollback after a failed first boot.
- Added bounded retries for temporary DNS, connection, rate-limit, and server failures during setup downloads.
- Made instant-mode credentials explicit in the account choice, setup splash, and a one-time first-desktop notification.

## v0.0.6-preview - 2026-08-29

- Added a stable launcher under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TryOmarchy` with optional Start-menu and Desktop shortcuts selected inside the branded setup window.
- Added an app compatibility guide covering Arch packages, VS Code, and current VM limitations.
- Added an optional instant trial account that skips the first-boot form and lands directly on the desktop.

Thanks to [Marx-Bray](https://github.com/Marx-Bray) for suggesting the launcher shortcuts in [issue #1](https://github.com/tsouth89/try-omarchy-windows/issues/1), and to everyone testing Try Omarchy across different Windows setups.

## v0.0.5-preview - 2026-08-29

- Reworked the setup splash with a clear SUPER-key explanation and starter shortcuts.
- Added safe cancellation that stops active downloads, removes partial setup data, and keeps the launcher.
- Authenticated the release manifest before downloading payloads and added recovery for incomplete installs.
- Prevented QEMU from trapping the Windows cursor when Try Omarchy is used over RDP.
- Documented essential keys, uninstalling, compatibility expectations, and common questions.

Thanks to [Tom Ballard](https://github.com/tcballard) for the release-manifest hardening and incomplete-install recovery in [PR #2](https://github.com/tsouth89/try-omarchy-windows/pull/2), and to everyone who tested the early previews and reported rough edges.

## v0.0.4-preview - 2026-08-29

- Kept the progress window visible until Omarchy opened.
- Sized guest memory to what the PC could spare and retried with less when needed.
- Kept setup errors visible above other windows.

## v0.0.3-preview - 2026-08-29

- Shipped the signed one-file Windows launcher.
- Added GPU runtime setup, graceful shutdown, clipboard sharing, folder sharing, and reliable guest reboot handling.
- Added the Omarchy 4.0.1 guest image used by later launcher releases.

## v0.0.2-preview - 2026-08-28

- Updated the guest to Omarchy 4.0.1 with all upstream themes.
- Added screensavers, autologin, clipboard sharing, host-folder mounting, and a visible SDL cursor.
