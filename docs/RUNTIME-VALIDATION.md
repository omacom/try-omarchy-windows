# Source-built runtime validation

The Runtime workflow produces an unsigned test artifact. Keep the public
runtime pin unchanged until all of these pass on Windows 11.

- `qemu-system-x86_64.exe --version` reports QEMU 11.0.0.
- `qemu-system-x86_64.exe -accel help` lists WHPX.
- Try Omarchy reaches the desktop using the rebuilt ZIP.
- Venus Vulkan starts on a supported GPU, including the existing GPU probe.
- CPU rendering still takes over when the GPU probe is forced to fail.
- Keyboard input, scoped Windows key handling, clipboard, audio, and sharing work.
- The host and guest cursors stay aligned during fast movement and fullscreen.
- Windowed, fullscreen, guest reboot, guest poweroff, and relaunch all work.
- The runtime archive extracts cleanly on a fresh machine without MSYS2 installed.
- Task Manager shows no unexpected console window or extra launcher process.

Test at least one AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA host before changing the public pin.
